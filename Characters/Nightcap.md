Nightcaps are fae beings with an extremely alien biology. Their bodies are in constant flux between the Plane of Faerie and the Ethereal Realm, which allows them to cross between them at will. Nightcaps wander between the two planes in search of victims. They are guided exclusively by instinct, their feelers indicating the nearest source of energy. They are obligate carnivores, but the way in which they obtain sustenance is unique: once a nightcap has killed its victim, it stands over it, casting its magical shadow over it. Its spores then decompose the body and fly back into the body of the nightcap, bringing it the nutrients from its prey. While that process is taking place, the nightcap remains completely motionless, and its beauty may be admired without risking your life, so it’s always important when encountering one to check if there are any corpses lying under its cap.

Unfortunately for the players, this Nightcap is actively hunting. The Nightcap attacks from the Ethereal Plane, invisible to the players and untouchable from the Plane of Faerie. To show the players how to reach it, whenever a character comes within 5 feet of one of the poppies, rather than simply asking for a saving throw, ask them if they wish to resist the flower putting them to sleep. If they do resist, have them make a DC 15 **Constitution saving throw** -- but if they don’t, or if they fail the saving throw, they awaken in the place where the Ethereal Realm makes contact with the Plane of Faerie, and are able to see and attack the Nightcap while their sleeping bodies remain in Faerie.

When the Nightcap is severely bloodied, have it disappear again, returning to the Plane of Faerie and attacking the players’ vulnerable, sleeping bodies. The characters must then wake themselves up, either by taking damage from the Nightcap; willing themselves awake by succeeding on a **Constitution saving throw** (DC 15); or another character taking an action to wake them, upon which the sleeping player can make a **Constitution saving throw** (DC 10) with advantage to wake up.
