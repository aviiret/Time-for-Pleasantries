Fae that feed on dreams.

The pleasantries are small faeries, around the size of a pixie, with chitinous bodies and vaguely humanoid faces. They have soft fur around their necks and long, feather-like antennae. Uncommon as they are, pleasantries are unfamiliar to the players, but with an **Intelligence (Nature)** check (DC 22) or an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check (DC 20), they can learn their name and figure out that these little faeries are likely servants or drones of a larger group, like hive insects -- and that they can clearly traverse realms with ease and put creatures to sleep.

They've been kidnapping people from Alacran for sustenance.

They offer a pleasant end to their victims' existence in a peaceful sleep with happy dreams.
