Fae that feed on dreams.

The pleasantries are small faeries, around the size of a pixie, with chitinous bodies and vaguely humanoid faces. They have soft fur around their necks and long, feather-like antennae. Uncommon as they are, pleasantries are unfamiliar to the players, but with an **Intelligence (Nature)** check (DC 22) or an **Intelligence (Arcana)** check (DC 20), they can learn their name and figure out that these little faeries are likely servants or drones of a larger group, like hive insects -- and that they can clearly traverse realms with ease and put creatures to sleep.

They've been kidnapping people from Alacran for sustenance.

They offer a pleasant end to their victims' existence in a peaceful sleep with happy dreams.

Pleasantries have a strict moral code, and do not see their way of feeding as immoral or bad.

They deliberately select those who are experiencing turmoil, hardship, or sadness in their lives as their sources of sustenance, and believe that by putting these people under a pleasant sleep they give them a much better end of their lives than their toilsome existence back in the Material Realm.

Pleasantries liken this to how people in the Material Realm keep cattle, and will argue that their way of treating their dreamers is much more “humane”.
