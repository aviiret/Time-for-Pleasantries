A fae creature that feeds on frustration. These faeries are attached to enchanted chests, and often hoard treasure within them, using them as bait. They then play illusion-based tricks and pranks like this on hapless treasure-seekers, filling their bellies with their victims’ annoyance. They’re generous with their treasure in return, so it’s a fair trade... at least, if you ask the Chest Weasel.

With every sigh or groan of frustration your players produce, this particular Weasel gets happier and happier; when you count ten expressions of annoyance, the Chest Weasel pops out of the chest and thanks them for the meal!

The Weasel offers the players what is actually hidden inside his chest: a [[Horn of Plenty]]. He is also happy to chat, perfectly friendly after he’s been fed so well, and may even provide some information about the faeries behind the kidnappings to particularly persuasive players.
