> You find yourself in the town of Alacran. It's eerily quiet, strangers are eyed with suspicion and no children roam the streets.

Let them explore the town and find leads.

An Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check (DC 13), or a Charisma (Deception, Persuasion, or Intimidation) check (DC 12), or any other means the characters may try, can lead the party towards someone willing to give them some information:

- People have been going to sleep and have been found missing from their beds in the morning. Most play it off as them running away, but it’s been happening a little too consistently for people’s comfort.

- There’s no apparent connection between the people who have been disappearing. They aren’t the same age, most don’t know each other too well, and most don’t live anywhere near each other.

- However, most of the people who have gone missing were going through some hardship.

- The most recent disappearance was a couple months ago, a child at an orphanage in town. It’s not the first child who’s disappeared from that orphanage, either.

- With an especially high roll, a child might tell the party pieces of the [[Orphanage|orphanage]] kids’ story below.


It should be obvious that their first stop is the [[Orphanage|orphanage]].
