As they enter the woods, plants begin to light up around them with a beautiful, eerie glow. They move through the forest for a long time, until Renata’s body brings them to a clearing filled with red poppies.

The moment her sleeping body touches the puddle, it glows brightly.

The puddle acts as a fae crossroad leading to [[Plane of Faerie|The Realm of Faerie]] for one minute after a sleeping body is laid in it. After Renata’s body sinks through it, the light begins to dim quickly -- but there’s just enough time for the party to jump through.
