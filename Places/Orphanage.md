>“The Alarcan orphanage is a small building at the end of the road, its brightly painted walls trying valiantly to look cheerful despite the building’s wear and tear. A small group of children plays quietly in one corner of the room under the watchful eye of an adult. A single girl sits apart from them, and raises her head to watch you as you enter.”

They are greeted by the orphanage's matron who confirms that the latest disappearance was a child from the orphanage, Sofia, but she thinks that she may have run away because she was rejected buy a potential home the week before.

Sofia's best friend [[Renata]] is shaken, but she is closed up and refusing to talk to anyone.

Once convinced that they are there to help Renata shares what she knows:

- The adults are saying that Sofia ran away, but she wouldn’t have done so without Renata. 
    
- There’s a rumor among the younger children in the orphanage that faeries are taking sad kids to their realm to play -- and that you’ll know you’re invited next if you start to dream of faeries. 
    
- One kid even says she saw Sofia start glowing and float out her window the night she disappeared.
    
- Sofia told Renata that she had had dreams about faeries before she disappeared.

Renata has been dreaming of faeries for a week. She knows she's next and wants to set a trap. She asks the party to stand watch secretly and follow where she goes. Must not get caught or the faeries won't come again.

The party can come up with a way to watch over her. 

With some exploration or investigation of the area, the players may notice some details about the orphanage that can help them plan. 

Renata has a room to herself here on the first floor, with a window not too far off the ground, though the walls are thin and sound travels easily between rooms. 

Due to the recent disappearances, the building is patrolled by a series of guards on rotating shifts ([[Guard|humanoid guards]]), but with a sufficient check or enough time watching, the characters can figure out the patterns and breaks in the shifts. Alarm spells, Dexterity (Stealth) checks, and watchful familiars may come in handy at this juncture.

The first few hours of the night pass without incident, though a call for Wisdom (Perception) checks will help create tension. In the middle of the night...

>“Slowly, the windows begin to open, creaking as they slowly move. Moonlight shines through them and pools on the sheets above Renata’s body as it, too, starts to move. Renata is still peacefully asleep, but her body rises above the bed, hovering limply. Color leaches from her, turning her almost translucent. As if carried by a gentle current, she floats out the windows and into the night.”

Following Renata’s body in secret, the characters make their way towards the [[Forest|forest]] at the outskirts of Alarcan.
