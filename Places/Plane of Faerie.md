Also known as the Feywild or simply Faerie.


>“As you pass through the portal, there’s a moment of disorientation. You can’t tell up from down, dark from light; your head spins -- and then you’re standing in a completely different place than you were before. Gone is the drab clearing in the moonlight -- instead, the sky bathes you in a twilight glow. Clouds move across it at different speeds, fast and then slow. The brackish water lapping at the shoreline of the island you stand on is iridescent, like the wings of a dragonfly, and the roots of the trees that grow out of [[The Shallows|the shallows]] are like thin stilts, holding massive trees over the waters of the swamp.”

Renata is there, ten feet away from the party -- but she’s not alone. Several [[Pleasantries|pleasantries]] surround her, flitting around her body and chittering to one another like insects. They go silent as soon as they notice the characters; they pause for a moment, then flee.

With the departure of the pleasantries, Renata falls five feet to the ground and startles awake. She urges the party to follow the pleasantries, going deeper into the Plane of Faerie, and help her find Sofia.

The party moves on deeper into [[The Shallows]].
