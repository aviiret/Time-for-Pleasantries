Region of the [[Plane of Faerie]], where the pleasantries have built their nest.


>“The dim light, the buzzling fireflies, and the humidity of the swamp give way to an expanse covered in beautiful flowers, upon which you see... beds. Dozens of beds are strewn around the meadow. Some have wooden frames, some wrought iron, some have intricately carved golden bedknobs -- and each of them holds a body, lying fast asleep. Overlooking each bed is a massive, blood-red poppy, its pollen falling gently over the sleeper’s face.
>
>Flying around the beds, you see the same tiny beings that had carried [[Renata]]’s sleeping body across the planes. They look up as you enter and freeze, and then a massive figure emerges from the flowers that blanket the meadow: equal parts humanoid and insectoid, with beautiful wings that flutter behind her like a moth, and a wicked stinger at the end of her abdomen.
>
>The [[Pleasantry Queen|Queen]] looks at you, and smiles.”

The pleasantries have no desire to fight the players, and a high-stakes social encounter will commence at this point. They only attack if attacked or when the party tries to wake up their dreamers.

The Pleasantry Queen is open to compromise. She believes strongly that she and her pleasantries are doing the right thing, but may be swayed slightly with clever roleplaying and persuasive points, or with a **Charisma (Persuasion)** check. The DC for this check is set at 15, but lower the DC or grant advantage on this roll for particularly good arguments or roleplay.

On a success, she concedes that taking dreamers from the same town was not the best solution for their grove, and proposes that they take dreamers from a variety of settlements, bringing the concentration of kidnappings from one town to a minimum.

# Endings
## A Planar Understanding:

If the players choose to leave the dreamers and the [[Pleasantries|pleasantries]] be, the pleasantries are overjoyed. They don’t like when denizens of the Material Realm venture into their grove -- or at least not while they are awake -- and will offer the players their aid in exchange for the party’s silence. If the party manages to successfully convince the pleasantries to vary the locations from where they obtain their dreamers, the pleasantries assure the party that they will honor that promise. If the party hasn’t found the [[Horn of Plenty]], have the Pleasantries give it to them as a parting gift. Emphasize that today the party made a powerful friend in the Plane of Faerie, and that many other pleasantry colonies will hear of their understanding.

The [[Pleasantry Queen]] offers to open a portal to the Material Realm, transporting the party back to the [[Forest|forest]] where they first entered the [[Plane of Faerie]].

[[Renata]] stays very quiet during this, and refuses to talk to the party at all during the long trek back home. When their paths are about to separate, Renata breaks her silence to state plainly that she will never forget how they left Sofia behind. While they may have made a friend in the [[Plane of Faerie]] today, they also made an enemy here, on the Material Realm.

## A Battle Among the Poppies:

If the players choose to take the dreamers with them, either by waking them up, attacking the pleasantries, or otherwise not reaching an understanding with the fae, a battle ensues.

[[Pleasantry Queen]] alone or with [[Pleasantries]] if too easy.

At the end of the battle, assuming the players kill the queen, the other pleasantries scream a shrill, ear-piercing cry and fly in all directions, leaving the grove to the players. The dreamers can be woken up easily, including Sofia, who Renata hugs tightly -- much to Sofia’s surprise; from her perspective, she just went to bed a couple of hours ago.

Some of the dreamers try to go back to sleep immediately after being woken up, wanting to go back to their pleasant dreams and now unable to do so because the pleasantries are gone.

The fae crossing at the edge of the Shallows opens when someone falls asleep in it from the Plane of Faerie too, so offer the players a long rest back where they started their journey into [[The Shallows|the Shallows]]. [[Renata]] will admit that she’s pretty tired after all that adventuring and fall into the lap of her rescued friend, opening the portal once more back to the real world and out of the pleasant -- and deadly -- faerie dream.
