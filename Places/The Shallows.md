Swamp dungeon in the [[Plane of Faerie]]

A clear path lies before the party in the form of a winding line of islands, connected by thin bridges of land or walkways made of the trees’ roots.

**Light.** The twilit sky sheds a diffuse bright light over the islands, unless otherwise noted.

**Water.** All of the islands, and the land- or tree-bridges between them, are surrounded by brackish water. The shores slope into shallow water, but it becomes 8-10 feet deep less than five feet out.

**Tree Cover.** The huge trees that dot the shallows provide a sparse canopy, but otherwise there is no ceiling.


Following the path ahead of them to the first large island leads the characters to the first encounter of the dungeon.

>“As you step onto the solid ground of an island, you find yourselves wading through a sea of flowers. Some are familiar to you, though they grow in unnatural colors -- blue roses, red violets, prismatic daisies with each petal a different shade -- while others are completely alien, strange shapes in brilliant hues. Most notable, though, are the poppies that grow here and there, each at least three feet tall. They sway enticingly in the light breeze, and little motes of glowing pollen float around them.”

Before the players can explore or interact much, they are attacked by an unseen enemy: a [[Nightcap]].




After defeating the Nightcap the players move deeper into the marsh.

They are met with an open area on an island, with a single chest laying innocuously in the center.

If inspected, the chest is unlocked and un-trapped, and opens to reveal another, slightly smaller chest inside. If this one is inspected, it is unlocked and un-trapped, and opens to reveal another, slightly smaller chest inside, and another, and another, and...

The chest is connected to a [[Chest Weasel]], a fae creature that feeds on frustration.


After the [[Chest Weasel]] encounter the party moves on to the next area.

>“As you reach the next area, you find yourselves in a gloomy forest. The trees are gnarled, and a few appear to have twisted trunks that resemble grotesque faces bearing horrific expressions. The air chills to the point where you can see your breath, and a thin veil of fog blankets the region. Every surface seems to be coated in a thin, oily substance with a colorful sheen to it; in some places, this substance has pooled into small puddles of black ichor.”

These black pools are actually [[Terror|terrors]].


Any creature not from the Plane of Faerie that looks into one of these small pools sees bizarre and twisted versions of past events -- versions of history where things went differently, and the outcome was worse for them. Every vision is unique and serves only to foster anxiety in those who stare. A creature who looks for more than a moment must succeed on a **DC 13 Wisdom saving throw** or suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw. A creature who succeeds by more than 5, however, has advantage on their next Wisdom saving throw.

As the characters try to wrench their gaze from the horrifying visions, a group of four [[Terror|terrors]] attacks. Each takes a form imitating the fear of one of the characters -- but an exaggerated, nightmarish version of that fear, a manifestation taken to the extreme. When a terror is killed, it reverts to its true form, a humanoid shape that looks to be made of a black oily substance.



>“Battered and bruised as you are, the next leg of the journey seems to go on forever. Strange as it is, the scenery of the Plane of Faerie seems to blend together into a familiar, technicolor monotony. Except -- wait. It’s not just that the unnatural colors of the swamp are becoming familiar. You’ve crossed a channel on a log bridge three times now...”

A powerful illusion guards the center of the marsh, trapping those who traverse it in an unending loop.

If the players swim out to one side, they appear ten minutes later on the other side of the corridor. If they try to take a different fork in the road, they eventually find themselves back at the start of the loop.

The only way to circumvent the illusion is for the party to walk right back the way they came -- although if your players come up with a different ingenious solution, don’t hesitate to allow it. Either way, when they are free from the loop, they find the swamp opening up before them, to reveal a vast meadow ([[The Poppy Grove]]).
