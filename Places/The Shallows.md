Swamp dungeon in the [[Plane of Faerie]]

A clear path lies before the party in the form of a winding line of islands, connected by thin bridges of land or walkways made of the trees’ roots.

**Light.** The twilit sky sheds a diffuse bright light over the islands, unless otherwise noted.

**Water.** All of the islands, and the land- or tree-bridges between them, are surrounded by brackish water. The shores slope into shallow water, but it becomes 8-10 feet deep less than five feet out.

**Tree Cover.** The huge trees that dot the shallows provide a sparse canopy, but otherwise there is no ceiling.


Following the path ahead of them to the first large island leads the characters to the first encounter of the dungeon.

>“As you step onto the solid ground of an island, you find yourselves wading through a sea of flowers. Some are familiar to you, though they grow in unnatural colors -- blue roses, red violets, prismatic daisies with each petal a different shade -- while others are completely alien, strange shapes in brilliant hues. Most notable, though, are the poppies that grow here and there, each at least three feet tall. They sway enticingly in the light breeze, and little motes of glowing pollen float around them.”

Before the players can explore or interact much, they are attacked by an unseen enemy: a [[Nightcap]].
