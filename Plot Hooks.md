One of these means can give the players starting information.

**Missing Persons**: Posters on buildings, a posting on the board of an adventurer’s guild, or a desperate quest-giver in a tavern offers a reward for finding missing children.

**Tall Tales**: Rumors are spreading between children of different towns, telling stories about children being taken away by faeries if they’re particularly good, bad, or unhappy -- and all the rumors seem to trace back to this one town.

**Relative to Renata**: An NPC the players know, or one of the player characters themselves, knows or grew up in an orphanage with a girl from a small village, who sends a message or letter asking for their aid.
