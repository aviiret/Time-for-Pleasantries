Beings created by accumulation of nightmares. 

Usually find right outside of [[The Poppy Grove|poppy groves]].

The [[Pleasantries]] discard the nightmares of their dreamers and those form Terrors.

Terrors act as guard dogs to the grove.

Any creature not from the Plane of Faerie that looks into one of these small pools sees bizarre and twisted versions of past events -- versions of history where things went differently, and the outcome was worse for them. Every vision is unique and serves only to foster anxiety in those who stare. A creature who looks for more than a moment must succeed on a DC 13 **Wisdom** saving throw or suffer disadvantage on their next saving throw. A creature who succeeds by more than 5, however, has advantage on their next Wisdom saving throw.
